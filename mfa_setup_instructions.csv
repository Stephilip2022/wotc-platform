OVERVIEW,What is MFA?,Multi-Factor Authentication adds an extra security layer to state portal logins. You'll need to collect MFA information from each state portal and add it to the WOTC platform.,
OVERVIEW,Why Collect MFA Info?,The automation bot needs MFA credentials to log into state portals and submit WOTC forms on your behalf. Without MFA info the bot cannot complete automated submissions.,
,,,
MFA TYPES,TOTP (Authenticator),Time-based One-Time Password - uses an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy. Most common type.,"Secret Key: JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP"
MFA TYPES,SMS,Text message codes sent to your phone number. Bot intercepts SMS messages.,"Phone: +1-555-123-4567"
MFA TYPES,Email,Codes sent to your email address. Requires email integration.,"Email: wotc@yourcompany.com"
MFA TYPES,Backup Codes,"One-time use codes (usually 10-12) provided when you first set up MFA. Save these!","1234-5678, 9876-5432, 4567-1234"
,,,
STEP-BY-STEP,Step 1: Log Into State Portal,"Go to the state's WOTC portal URL and log in with your existing credentials","For Texas: https://www.twc.texas.gov/wotc"
STEP-BY-STEP,Step 2: Find Security Settings,"Look for menu options like: Account Settings, Security, Two-Factor Authentication, or Multi-Factor Authentication","Usually found in: Profile → Security or Account → Settings"
STEP-BY-STEP,Step 3: Enable MFA (if not enabled),"Click 'Enable Two-Factor Authentication' or similar button. Portal will ask you to choose a method (TOTP/SMS/Email)","Choose: Authenticator App (TOTP) - most reliable"
STEP-BY-STEP,Step 4A: For TOTP - Get Secret Key,"Portal shows a QR code. Look for text that says 'Can't scan? Enter this code manually' - that's your secret key. Copy it!","Secret Key shown: ABCD1234EFGH5678IJKL (16-32 characters)"
STEP-BY-STEP,Step 4B: For SMS - Get Phone Number,"Portal asks for phone number. Note which number you provided.","Phone: +1-555-555-1234"
STEP-BY-STEP,Step 4C: For Email - Get Email Address,"Portal asks for email address. Note which email you provided.","Email: admin@yourcompany.com"

TOTP DETAILS,What is a TOTP Secret?,"A 16-32 character string that generates time-based codes. This is what you'll enter into our platform - NOT the 6-digit codes.","Example: JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP or ABCD1234EFGH5678"
TOTP DETAILS,Where to Find It?,Under the QR code during MFA setup. Look for 'Manual entry' or 'Can't scan?' link,"Text usually says: 'Enter this key manually: JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP'"
TOTP DETAILS,Common Mistakes,"DON'T: Scan QR code with authenticator app. DON'T: Enter the 6-digit code. DO: Copy the secret key text.","Wrong: 123456 (that's a code, not the secret)"
TOTP DETAILS,How Our Bot Uses It,The bot uses the secret to generate fresh 6-digit codes automatically whenever it needs to log in,"Bot calculates: 123456 (valid for 30 seconds)"
,,,
SMS DETAILS,What Phone Number?,The phone number that receives SMS codes from the state portal,"Example: +1-555-123-4567 or (555) 123-4567"
SMS DETAILS,How Our Bot Uses It?,Bot intercepts SMS messages sent to this number and extracts the verification code,"Bot receives: 'Your verification code is 123456'"
,,,
EMAIL DETAILS,What Email Address?,The email address that receives verification codes from the state portal,"Example: wotc@yourcompany.com"
EMAIL DETAILS,How Our Bot Uses It?,Bot checks this email inbox and extracts codes from state portal emails,"Email subject: 'Your WOTC Portal Verification Code: 123456'"
,,,
BACKUP CODES,What Are They?,"One-time use codes provided when you first enable MFA. Each can only be used once.","Example: 1234-5678, 9876-5432, 4567-1234"
BACKUP CODES,When Are They Shown?,Only ONCE when you first set up MFA. Portal won't show them again.,"Portal says: 'Save these codes now. You won't see them again.'"
BACKUP CODES,How Many?,"Usually 10-12 codes provided","Example: 10 codes like 1234-5678"
BACKUP CODES,How Our Bot Uses Them?,If primary MFA fails the bot can use a backup code as fallback,"Bot uses: 1234-5678 (then marks it as used)"

TIPS,Start with High-Volume States,"Begin with states where you process the most WOTC claims","Priority: CA, TX, FL, NY, OH"
TIPS,Do One State at a Time,Don't try to set up all 50 states at once. Take breaks to avoid confusion.,"Monday: 5 states, Tuesday: 5 states, etc."
TIPS,Automation-Enabled States First,"Focus on states with automation enabled (CA, FL, GA, MI, NY, OH, TX) for immediate ROI","These states have Playwright bots ready"
TIPS,Keep a Spreadsheet,"Use the State MFA Tracking Checklist CSV to track your progress","Mark each state as: Not Started, In Progress, or Complete"
TIPS,Store Backup Codes Safely,"Save backup codes in a password manager or secure document. Each can only be used once.","Use: LastPass, 1Password, or encrypted file"
TIPS,Test After Setup,"After adding credentials for a state, test a submission to verify everything works","Submit a test WOTC form through the automation"
,,,
TROUBLESHOOTING,Can't Find MFA Settings,"Look for: Security, Account Settings, Two-Factor Auth, Login Security, Advanced Security","Try searching portal help docs for 'MFA' or '2FA'"
TROUBLESHOOTING,QR Code but No Secret,"Look for links like: 'Can't scan?', 'Manual entry', 'Enter code manually', or 'Trouble scanning?'","These reveal the text secret key"
TROUBLESHOOTING,MFA Not Offered,"Some states may not require MFA yet. Mark as 'N/A' and just enter User ID/Password","Status: No MFA Required"
TROUBLESHOOTING,Forgot to Save Backup Codes,"Most portals let you regenerate backup codes in Security Settings. Old codes become invalid.","Generate new set: Security → Regenerate Backup Codes"
TROUBLESHOOTING,Wrong Secret Key Format,"Secret should be 16-32 alphanumeric characters (no spaces). If it has spaces, remove them.","Wrong: JBSW Y3DP EHPK 3PXP, Right: JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP"
,,,
CHECKLIST,Before You Start,"Have: 1) Login credentials ready, 2) Password manager open, 3) Tracking spreadsheet, 4) Time (2-3 min per state)",
CHECKLIST,During Setup,"Do: 1) Log into state portal, 2) Enable MFA, 3) Copy secret key, 4) Save backup codes, 5) Update spreadsheet",
CHECKLIST,After Setup,"Verify: 1) Secret key saved, 2) Backup codes saved, 3) Spreadsheet updated, 4) Credentials added to platform, 5) Test submission",
,,,
QUESTIONS,How long does this take?,"2-3 minutes per state. About 2-3 hours total for all 50 states if done in one sitting (not recommended - do in batches)","Recommended: 10 states per day over 5 days"
QUESTIONS,Do all states require MFA?,"No, many states don't require MFA yet. You'll discover this as you log into each portal.","Estimate: 20-30% of states have MFA enabled"
QUESTIONS,What if I make a mistake?,"You can always edit credentials in the platform. Go to State Credentials → Edit → Update MFA info → Save",
QUESTIONS,Is my MFA info secure?,"Yes, all credentials and MFA secrets are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage. Even admins can't see the decrypted values in the database.",
QUESTIONS,Can I bulk upload credentials?,"Not currently. Each state must be entered individually through the State Credentials interface for security reasons.",
