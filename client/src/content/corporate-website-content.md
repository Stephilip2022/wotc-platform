# WHAT IS WOTC?

## The Work Opportunity Tax Credit Explained

The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a federal tax incentive program designed to encourage employers to hire individuals from targeted groups who face significant barriers to employment. Created by Congress and administered by the Department of Labor and IRS, WOTC provides a dollar-for-dollar reduction in federal tax liability for qualifying hires.

### The Economic Impact

- **$9,600 maximum credit** per qualified veteran employee
- **$2,400 to $9,600** per qualified employee depending on target group
- **No limit** on the number of eligible employees
- **Dollar-for-dollar** reduction in federal income tax liability
- **Carryback 1 year / Carryforward 20 years** for unused credits

### WOTC Target Groups

1. **Veterans** - Including disabled veterans, unemployed veterans, and SNAP-receiving veterans
2. **TANF Recipients** - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families long-term recipients
3. **SNAP Recipients** - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps) recipients ages 18-39
4. **Designated Community Residents** - Empowerment Zone or Rural Renewal County residents
5. **Vocational Rehabilitation Referrals** - State or VA vocational rehabilitation program participants
6. **Ex-Felons** - Individuals convicted of a felony and hired within one year of conviction or release
7. **SSI Recipients** - Supplemental Security Income recipients
8. **Summer Youth Employees** - Ages 16-17 from Empowerment Zones working during summer months
9. **Long-Term Unemployment Recipients** - Unemployed for 27+ consecutive weeks and received state/federal unemployment

### Why Most Employers Miss WOTC Credits

Studies show that **70-80% of eligible WOTC credits go unclaimed** each year. Why?

- **Complex eligibility requirements** across 9 target groups
- **28-day filing deadline** from hire date (Form 8850 must be submitted within 28 days)
- **State-by-state submission requirements** with different portals and processes
- **Document collection challenges** for verifying eligibility
- **Manual tracking** of hours worked for credit calculation
- **Lack of integration** with existing HR/payroll systems

**Rockerbox solves every one of these problems.**

# WHY ROCKERBOX?

## 90% More Advanced Than Any Other WOTC System

Rockerbox isn't just another WOTC software—it's the most technologically advanced tax credit automation platform ever built. While competitors rely on manual processes, paper forms, and basic screening questionnaires, Rockerbox delivers:

### The Rockerbox Difference

| Capability | Legacy Systems | Rockerbox |
|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Screening | Basic questionnaires | AI-powered with eligibility prediction |
| Languages | English only or 2-3 languages | 9 languages with real-time translation |
| State Submissions | Manual portal entry | 56-state zero-touch automation |
| Document Processing | Manual data entry | AI-powered OCR extraction |
| Integrations | CSV imports only | Bidirectional API sync with major systems |
| Credit Tracking | Spreadsheets | Real-time dashboards with forecasting |
| Compliance | Manual audits | Automated compliance monitoring |
| API Access | None | Full REST API with webhooks |

### What "Zero-Touch Processing" Really Means

From the moment a new hire completes their screening questionnaire, Rockerbox takes over completely:

1. **Automatic eligibility determination** using AI with confidence scoring
2. **Digital ETA Form 8850/9198 generation** with e-signatures
3. **Intelligent submission queue** that prioritizes by deadline and credit value
4. **State portal automation** with credential management and MFA handling
5. **OCR scanning** of determination letters when they arrive
6. **Automatic credit calculation** based on actual hours worked
7. **Integration with payroll** to track the 400-hour milestone for maximum credits

**Your team never touches a form, never logs into a state portal, and never manually calculates a credit.**

# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

## General WOTC Questions

**Q: How much can my company save with WOTC?**

**Q: Do I need to change my hiring practices?**
A: No. WOTC is about identifying which of your existing hires qualify???it's not about hiring differently. You hire the best candidates; we identify the credits.

**Q: How long does implementation take?**
A: Most employers are fully operational within 4 weeks. Enterprise implementations with complex integrations may take 6-8 weeks.

**Q: Will employees know they're being screened?**

A: Rockerbox sends automated reminders. Our average completion rate is 95%+ due to mobile optimization and gamified design.

**Q: How do you handle state portal downtime?**
A: Our automation includes retry logic with exponential backoff. If a portal is down, we queue submissions and retry automatically until successful.
