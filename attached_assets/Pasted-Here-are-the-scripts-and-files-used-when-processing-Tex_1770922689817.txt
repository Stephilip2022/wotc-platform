Here are the scripts and files used when processing Texas (TX) WOTC submissions through automation. I am also providing the TX credential file for reference. Below is a description of each script or file and how it is used.

TX.Cred
This file contains the Texas state portal login credentials in an encrypted format. These credentials are required to access the Texas workforce agency portal. In the new system, this should be handled through a secure credential management process where only Admins and CSMs have permission to view or update the information. States frequently require password rotations, while usernames rarely change. This should function more like a secure credential vault rather than a static file.

TX Template Build
This script builds the Texas state submission template using data pulled from the database. It applies WOTC-specific logic and formatting rules and outputs a file that meets the exact submission requirements of the Texas workforce agency.

TXUploader
This script automates interaction with the Texas state portal. It logs into the portal, uploads the prepared Texas submission template, and retrieves any error or rejection files returned by the state. If an error file exists, it is saved to a designated folder in Google Drive for review and remediation.

The following scripts may not be required long-term but may be useful during a transition period. They are intended to support clients still operating on the current dashboard or hybrid integrations while the new system is being rolled out.

TX RB Ready Create
This script builds a template used to update employee records in the current Rockerbox dashboard. Employees included in this file are marked as pending after being submitted to the Texas workforce agency.

TX RB Dash Upload
This script automates navigation to the Rockerbox dashboard and uploads the file generated by TX RB Ready Create to apply the pending status updates.

Please note: I do not run these individually, but rather they trigger each other after that script has run. Example first one triggers the second, and the second triggers the third. 

I will also mention - TX does have bot automation detection and will block attempts if the speed is not human-like.
