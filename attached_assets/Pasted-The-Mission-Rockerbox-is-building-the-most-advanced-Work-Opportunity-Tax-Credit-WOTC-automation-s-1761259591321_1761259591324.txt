The Mission

Rockerbox is building the most advanced Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) automation system ever created — a fully-intelligent, frictionless experience for employers, employees, and partners.
The goal is to achieve 100% screening compliance, zero manual intervention, and maximum credit capture — while transforming the WOTC program into a measurable, transparent, and revenue-driving asset.

🌐 Platform Overview

The Rockerbox WOTC Optimization System is a multi-tenant SaaS platform with four key user groups:

New Hires (Employees) — complete a simplified, mobile-first WOTC questionnaire.

Employers — manage screening compliance, upload payroll data, and track certified credits in real time.

Rockerbox Admin Team — oversee employer onboarding, document automation, and state agency submissions.

Licensees / Partners (White-Label) — CPA firms, payroll providers, or HCM vendors who resell the Rockerbox system under their brand.

Each user experiences a branded, role-specific interface — powered by a shared intelligence engine that automates the flow of data, documents, and credits.

⚙️ Core Functional Workflows
1. Employer Onboarding Workflow

Admin creates a new client via the ETA Form 9198 Intake Portal.

The system auto-populates the client’s form, emails an e-signature request, and links to the Rockerbox Terms of Service (engagement letter).

Once signed, the employer account and custom WOTC screening questionnaire are auto-generated.

Employer receives:

A unique WOTC questionnaire URL

A branded QR code for job postings and onboarding packets

An OpenAPI endpoint to integrate directly into their HRIS, ATS, or onboarding system.

2. New Hire Screening Workflow

New hires receive the employer’s WOTC link or QR code.

They’re guided through a gamified, AI-assisted questionnaire modeled after IRS Form 8850 and ETA Form 9061.

Questions are rewritten dynamically for clarity and literacy level (using OpenAI-powered simplification).

On submission:

A unique 9-digit confirmation code is generated.

Employees can upload documentation (driver’s license, DD-214, etc.).

Completed forms are stored in the employer’s secure tenant, ready for state submission.

3. State Submission Workflow

The system aggregates all completed questionnaires by state.

With one click, admins can generate state-specific bulk CSV templates (43 formats pre-built).

The Auto-State Submission Robot (Playwright-based) logs into each State Workforce Agency (SWA) portal and uploads the correct file automatically.

The robot dashboard shows submission success and timestamps per state.

4. Determination & Certification Workflow

The system automatically monitors SWA portals and SFTP/email boxes for determination files.

Files are parsed via OCR to identify certifications, denials, or requests for more info.

Each employee’s profile updates with their status: Certified, Denied, or Pending.

Certified employees become eligible for ongoing credit calculations.

5. Payroll & Credit Calculation Workflow

Employers upload payroll files or connect via API (ADP, Paycor, Paychex, Gusto, QuickBooks, etc.).

The Universal Payroll Adapter auto-detects schema and maps data correctly — even across multiple formats.

The Credit Engine calculates credits based on:

Hours worked (120/400 thresholds)

Target group eligibility

State certification status

Monthly credit amounts are generated automatically by the 10th of each month.

6. Billing & Payment Workflow

For each employer, the system automatically generates an invoice equal to a percentage of credits earned (typically 15%).

Clients with Auto-Pay enabled are charged via Stripe; others receive an invoice via FreshBooks integration.

All invoices, payments, and credit balances are synchronized between systems.

Licensee partners have built-in revenue-share tracking for commission splits.
