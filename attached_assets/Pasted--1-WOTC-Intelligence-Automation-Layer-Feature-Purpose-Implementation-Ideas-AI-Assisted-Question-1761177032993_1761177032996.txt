🧠 1. WOTC Intelligence & Automation Layer
Feature	Purpose	Implementation Ideas
AI-Assisted Questionnaire	Detect and rephrase confusing questions dynamically for low-literacy users.	Use OpenAI GPT model or Hugging Face QG to reword questions at runtime based on reading score.
Auto-State Submission Robot	Automatically login and upload bulk CSVs to each State Workforce Agency.	Headless Chrome (Puppeteer/Playwright) + stored credentials per state + dashboard for automation status.
WOTC Optimization Scoring Engine	Benchmark each employer’s screening %, submission %, and certification rates.	OptimizationScore = (Screening% * Submittal% * CertRate%) × CreditPerEmployee. Store trendlines.
Automated State Determination Importer	OCR or API integration to pull determination results (Certified/Denied/Missing Info).	Periodically scrape SFTP/Email inbox or state portals, classify docs, parse determination type.
Payroll Sync Engine (Universal Adapter)	Continuously sync payroll files (ADP, Paycor, Paychex, QuickBooks, etc.).	Build “Payroll Connector” layer with mappers for top 10 formats. Auto-detect schema + OCR fallback.
📈 2. Analytics & Insights
Feature	Value	Notes
Real-Time Credit Forecasting	Predict expected credits 30–90 days out.	Use ML regression based on historical hires, certifications, and tenure.
Per-Branch / Per-Recruiter Leaderboards	Gamify optimization across multi-location employers.	Rank locations on screening %, certification %, and average credit.
Attrition vs. Certification Correlation	Quantify how WOTC-eligible hires affect retention.	Pull tenure data from payroll API and visualize “avg tenure by WOTC status.”
Credit Recovery Dashboard	Show credits lost due to incomplete or denied submissions.	Monetize this by offering “credit recovery campaigns.”
⚙️ 3. Employer Tools
Feature	Purpose	Notes
Embedded Employer Widgets	Allow employers to embed the WOTC widget directly into their ATS / onboarding workflow.	Create embeddable <iframe> or React widget SDK with employer key.
Custom Retention Pathways	Incentivize employees with milestones (WOTC screening, 120/400 hours, training completion, etc.).	Add reward tiers & point redemption via gift card APIs (Tremendous, Tango Card).
In-App Support Assistant (AI)	Answer employer questions about WOTC and program metrics instantly.	Embed a GPT-based chatbot fine-tuned on your FAQs and docs.
Automated Client Health Emails	Weekly digest: screening %, missed credits, certifications, ROI.	Use CRON + email templating (MJML + Nodemailer).
🤝 4. Partner / Licensee Ecosystem
Feature	Benefit	Implementation
White-Label Tenant Generator API	Instantly spawn licensee environments with branding & billing rules.	Extend /api/v1/licensees/create with logo upload, pricing % field, and default color palette.
Revenue-Share Tracking	Split fees automatically between Rockerbox and licensees.	Store per-licensee “revenue_share_pct” and allocate Stripe transfers.
Partner Portal	Analytics & onboarding for CPAs, payroll firms, and HCM partners.	Add /partner portal with multi-employer roll-up metrics and usage analytics.
Open Developer API + Sandbox	Allow external HRIS vendors to integrate directly.	Use OAuth2 + API keys + interactive Swagger playground.
🔐 5. Compliance, Security, & Audit Enhancements
Area	Description	Implementation
SOC-II-Ready Audit Trails	Record every data modification (who, what, when).	Extend src/lib/audit/log.ts to include actor, entity_type, entity_id.
PII Encryption & Vaulting	Encrypt SSNs and sensitive info before storage.	AES-256 + unique salt per employer.
Access Scopes & RBAC Enforcement	Granular permissions (view, edit, export).	Add middleware that checks role + scope claims in JWT.
E-Sign Compliance (ESIGN + UETA)	Capture IP, timestamp, and device fingerprint for all e-signatures.	Store signature metadata JSON next to PDF.
Data Retention Policies	Auto-purge data older than X years (IRS guidance).	CRON cleanup + retention settings per client.
💳 6. Advanced Billing & Accounting Integration
Feature	Why It Matters	Implementation
Dynamic Pricing Rules	Charge different % per credit tier or client size.	Employer plan settings table + formula: if credits > $X → reduce %.
Auto-Reconciliation with FreshBooks	Sync paid invoices bi-directionally.	Webhook from Stripe → update FreshBooks invoice status.
ACH + Check Deposit Uploads	Allow manual payment confirmations.	Employer can upload remittance PDF, mark as paid.
Consolidated Monthly Statements	For multi-entity licensees.	Aggregate all invoices + credits → one PDF statement.
